                                    Nirmal was part of my team in Mindtree. He joined us fresh out of college and as part of innovative and growing AI practice that we had formed in Mindtree. Being in the most upcoming space and as part of growing skill set, every member of the team required
                                    to have a innovative and exploring mindset. Nirmal was a perfect fit to the same. Given any challenge by the architects, he would go research and come up with solutions. He never hesitated to pick new skills. His exploitative
                                    attitude enabled him to go to any corner to find the best fit of the solution. He would do all experiments and get his hands dirty.

                                    He was best liked for his attitude and approach to solving the problem. He was well recognized by the Sr. Leadership of Mindtree for contributions toward growing the new practice.

                                    For instance, I tasked him to integrate a 3D model with live data integrated with an ML model for prediction. He not only learned Unity, but also researched, identified, developed, integrated and hosted the model, all this in a week's time. In short,
                                    Nirmal is sharp, dedicated to his role and excels in completing technical challenges consistently.
