                <p>Established an intelligent chatbot that replaces human involvement by 80% that connects with other API services to resolve the ticket. Unknown manual resolving actions are recorded and suggested for similar issues in future occurring tickets.
                    The time to resolve similar ticket that had occurred earlier has been decreased by nearly 60% without human intervention.</p>

        <!-- Detailed Description of the project-->
        <div class="detailed-description">
            <p>
                <strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Microsoft Bot Service, LUIS API, Nodejs, Third-party serives API, Azure Functions
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Objective:</strong> Handle service tickets that are raised in a project without human intervention.<br>
                <br> Generally, during a project, that are incident tickets that are raised and the ticket is addressed by a concerned project team along with the Subject Matter Expert(SME) and also there is a time period that is given to resolve the
                ticket. Resolving the ticket in a lesser timeframe is very important as it could lead to customers' dissatisfaction. Hence developed a incident management chatbot that can help resolve all the tickets that are raised within a project.
                <br><br> The chatbot is entirely devloped with the help of Microsoft Bot Service which helped to deploy the bots and scale the servers up/down with respect to the traffic. The bots are specifically tied to webhooks which keeps an eye on
                the new tickets that are raised and triggers the bot and the concerned teammates are brought together in the chat.<br><br> The bot helps in bringing in all the third party services at one place with just a query away. For example, if a
                server in crashes down the user does not need to open a separate application to identify the server that is down. Just a query to the bot would fetch the right answer by connecting with the third party applications that are involved with
                the project. The entire chat transcript is followed by the bot and the final solution that is assigned to the ticket is recorded. Hence in future if there are any new ticekts that pop up similar to the ones that are solved, the bot tries
                the solution at first and only in vain triggers the team to join up. Intelligence was a additional component that was added to the bot which is periodically trained by a human manually to answer up the questions that the bought could not
                handle in the past.
